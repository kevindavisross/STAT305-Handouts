# Equally Likely Outcomes, Counting Rules, and Uniform Probability Meaures




## Equally likely outcomes {#equally-likely}


- For a sample space $\Omega$ with finitely many possible outcomes, assuming  **equally likely outcomes** corresponds to a probabiliy measure $\text{P}$ which satisfies
$$
\text{P}(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{\text{number of outcomes in $A$}}{\text{number of outcomes in $\Omega$}} \qquad{\text{when outcomes are equally likely}}
$$
- Even if the sample space outcomes are equally likely, the possible values of related random variables are usually not.



::: {#exm-coin-probspace}

Flip a coin 4 times and record the results in sequence.
For example, HTHH indicates T on the second flip and H on the others.
Let $X$ be the number of H in the four flips.
Assume that the coin is fair and the flips are independent.

::: {#exm-matching-probspace}
Recall the matching problem with $n=4$: objects labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, are placed at random in spots labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, with spot 1 the correct spot for object 1, etc.
Recall the sample space from Example \@ref(exm:matching-outcome). 
Let the random variable $X$ count the number of objects that are put back in the correct spot. (Hint: recall Table \@ref(tab:matching-indicator-tab).)
Let $\text{P}$ denote the probability measure corresponding to the assumption that the objects are equally likely to be placed in any spot, so that the 24 possible placements are equally.

## Some counting rules {#counting}

- Computing probabilities in the equally likely case reduces to just counting outcomes.

::: {#exm-counting-icecream}

I'm serving ice cream to my kids.  They can choose to have a bowl or a cone with a single scoop from one of four different flavors.
:::

1. How many different ways could I serve the ice cream?  (For example, peppermint in a cone, birthday cake in a bowl, etc)
\
\
\
\
1. Now suppose they can either add rainbow or chocolate sprinkles or not. How many different ways could I serve the ice cream?  (For example, peppermint in a cone with chocolate sprinkles, birthday cake in a bowl with rainbow sprinkles, etc.)
\
\
\
\
1. Now suppose the kids who requested bowls could choose whether to have whipped cream on top.  Is the number of different ways I could serve the ice cream equal to the answer to the previous part multiplied by two?
\
\

- *Multiplication principle for counting.** Suppose that stage 1 of a process can be completed
in any one of $n_1$ ways. Further, suppose that for each way of completing the stage 1,
stage 2 can be completed in any one of $n_2$ ways. Then the two-stage process can
be completed in any one of $n_1\times n_2$ ways.
- This rule extends naturally to a $\ell$-stage process,
which can then be completed in any one of $n_1\times n_2\times n_3\times\cdots\times n_\ell$ ways. 
- In the multiplication principle it is not important whether there is a "first" or "second" stage.  What is important is that there are distinct stages, each with its own number of "choices".



::: {#exm-ceo1}
Suppose the board of directors of a corporation has identified 5 candidates --- Ariana, Beyonce, Cardi, Drake, Elvis --- for three executive positions: chief executive officer (CEO), chief financial officer (CFO), and chief operating officer (COO). In the interest of fairness, the board assigns 3 of the 5 candidates to the positions completely at random. No individual can hold more than one of the positions.

When calculating probabilities below, consider the sample space of all possible executive teams.
:::

1. How many executive teams are possible?
\
\
\
\
1. What is the probability that Ariana is CEO, Beyonce is CFO, and Cardi is COO?  
\
\
\
\
1. What is the probability that Ariana is CEO and Beyonce is CFO?

- **Number of ordered arrangements.** The number of *ordered arrangements* of $k$ items, selected *without* replacement from a set of $n$ distinct items is
$$
n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
$$
- Recall the **factorial** notation: $m!=m(m-1)(m-2)\cdots (3)(2)(1)$.  For example, $5!=5\times4\times3\times2\times1=120$.  By definition, 0!=1.


::: {#exm-ceo2}
Your boss is forming a committee of 3 people for a new project team, and 5 people --- Ariana, Beyonce, Cardi, Drake, Elvis--- have volunteered to be on the committee.  In the interest of fairness, 3 of the 5 people will be selected uniformly at random to form the committee.
:::

1. How is this situation different from the executive team example?
\
\
\
\
1. How many possible committees consist of Ariana, Beyonce, Cardi?  How many executive teams consisted of Ariana, Beyonce, Cardi?
\
\
\
\
1. How many different possible committees of 3 people can be formed from the 5 volunteers?
\
\
\
\

- The following is the relationship between "ordered" and "unordered" counting.
\scriptsize{
\begin{align*}
		\left(\text{number of \emph{ordered} selections of $k$ from $n$}\right) & = \left(\text{number of \emph{unordered} selections of $k$ from $n$}\right)\\
		&\quad \times\left(\text{number of ways of arranging the $k$ items in order}\right).
\end{align*}
}
- **Number of permutations.**  The number of ways of arranging $k$ items in order is
$$
k\times (k-1)\times (k-2)\times\cdots\times 3\times 2\times1 = k!
$$
- **Number of combinations.**  The number of ways to choose $k$ items without replacement from a group of $n$ distinct items where *order does not matter*, denoted $\binom{n}{k}$, is
$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$
- The quantity on the right is just a compact way of representing the quantity in the middle.  But since factorials can be very large, it's best to use the quantity in the middle to compute. In R: `choose(n, k)`. In Python: `scipy.special.comb(n, k)`
- The symbol $\binom{n}{k}$ is by definition equal to the quantity in the middle above.  It is read as "$n$ choose $k$" and is referred to as a **binomial coefficient**.

## Uniform probability measures {#sec-uniform-prob}


- The continuous analog of equally likely outcomes is a **uniform probability measure**.
- When the sample space is uncountable, size is measured continuously (length, area, volume) rather that discretely (counting).

$$
\text{P}(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{\text{size of } A}{\text{size of } \Omega} \qquad \text{if $\text{P}$ is a uniform probability measure}
$$

- For a continuous random variable, the probability it takes any particular value is 0.
