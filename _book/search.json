    "text": "Probability comes up in a wide variety of situations. Consider just a few examples.\n\nThe probability that you roll doubles in a turn of a board game.\nThe probability you win the next Powerball lottery if you purchase a single ticket, 4-8-15-16-42, plus the Powerball number, 23.\nThe probability that a “randomly selected” Cal Poly student is a California resident.\nThe probability that the high temperature in San Luis Obispo next Tuesday is above 90 degrees F.\nThe probability that the Philadelphia Eagles win the next Superbowl.\nThe probability that the Republican candidate wins the 2032 U.S. Presidential Election.\nThe probability that extraterrestrial life currently exists somewhere in the universe.\nThe probability that you ate an apple on April 17, 2009.\n\n\nExample 1.1 How are the situations above similar, and how are they different? What is one feature that all of the situations have in common? Is the interpretation of “probability” the same in all situations? The goal here is to just think about these questions, and not to compute any probabilities (or to even think about how you would).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA phenomenon is random if there are multiple potential outcomes, and there is uncertainty about which outcome will occur.\nUncertainty is understood in broad terms, and in particular does not only concern future occurrences.\nMany phenomena involve physical randomness, like flipping a coin or drawing powerballs at random from a bin, or in statistical applications of random sampling or random assignment.\nBut in many other situations, randomness just vaguely reflects uncertainty.\nRandom does not mean haphazard. In a random phenomenon, while individual outcomes are uncertain, there is a regular distribution of outcomes over a large number of (hypothetical) repetitions.\nAlso, random does not necessarily mean equally likely. In a random phenomenon, certain outcomes or events might be more or less likely than others.\nThe probability of an event associated with a random phenomenon is a number in the interval \\([0, 1]\\) measuring the event’s likelihood or degree of uncertainty. A probability can take any value in the continuous scale from 0% to 100%.\nThere are two main interpretations of probability.\n\nLong run relative frequency. The probability of an event can be interpreted as the proportion of times that the event would occur in a very large number of hypothetical repetitions of the random phenomenon.\nSubjective probability. There are many situations where the outcome is uncertain, but it does not make sense to consider the situation as repeatable. In such situations, a subjective (a.k.a., personal) probability describes the degree of likelihood a given individual ascribes to a certain event. Think of subjective probabilities as measuring relative degrees of likelihood rather than long run relative frequencies.\n\nFortunately, the mathematics of probability work the same way regardless of the interpretation. In either case, the same basic logical consistency requirements must be satisfied.\nA simulation involves an artificial recreation of the random phenomenon, usually using a computer. The probability of an event can be approximated by simulating the random phenomenon a large number of times and determining the proportion of simulated repetitions on which the event occurred out of the total number of repetitions in the simulation.\n\n\nExample 1.2 One of the oldest documented problems in probability is the following: If three fair six-sided dice are rolled, what is more likely: a sum of 9 or a sum of 10?\n\n\nExplain how you could conduct a simulation to investigate this question.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1 million repetitions of a simulation, a sum of 9 occurred in 115392 repetitions and a sum of 10 occurred in 125026 repetitions. Use the simulation results to approximate the probability that the sum is 9; repeat for a sum of 10.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be shown that the theoretical probability that the sum is 9 is 25/216 = 0.116. Write a clearly worded sentence interpreting this probability as a long run relative frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be shown that the theoretical probability that the sum is 10 is 27/216 = 0.125. How many times more likely is a sum of 10 than a sum of 9?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.3 The weather forecast calls for a 30% chance of rain in your city tomorrow. You ask Donny Don’t to interpret the 30% as a long run relative frequency. Donny says: “it will rain in 30% of the city tomorrow”. You ask him to elaborate; he says: “Well, there are many different locations in the city. In some of the locations it will rain, in some it won’t. It will rain in 30% of the locations, and not in the other 70%. That is, rain will cover 30% of the area of the city, and the other 70% won’t have rain.” Do you agree? If not, how would you interpret the 30% as a long run relative frequency?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen interpreting the long run, be careful to define the random phenomenon that is being repeated\n\n\nExample 1.4 In the first 7 games of his NBA career, Paolo Banchero attempted 60 free throws and successfully made 44. Donny Don’t says “the probability that Paolo Banchero successfully makes a free throw attempt is 44/60 = 0.733.” Do you agree? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistinguish between the short run and the long run\nObserved relative frequencies based on past data (sometimes called “empirical probabilities”) are only short run approximations to theoretical probabilities which represent long run relative frequencies\n\n\nExample 1.5 Your favorite local weatherperson forecasts a 30% chance of rain tomorrow and a 60% chance of rain the next day in your city.\n\nExplain how these probabilities are subjective.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou ask Donny Don’t to interpret these values as relative degrees of likelihood. Donny says: “Well, 30% is not that big, so it’s not going to rain that hard tomorrow. Also, 60% is twice is big as 30%, so it’s going to rain twice as hard two days from now as it will tomorrow”. Do you agree? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\nDonny says: “Can’t we just look at the data from all the days with weather conditions similar to the ones forecast for tomorrow, and see how often it rained on those days to find the probability of rain tomorrow? No subjectivity about that!” How would you respond?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA probabilistic forecast combines observed data and statistical or mathematical models to make predictions.\nRather than providing a single prediction such as “it will rain tomorrow”, probabilistic forecasts provide a range of scenarios and their relative likelihoods.\nSuch forecasts are subjective in nature, relying upon the data used and assumptions of the model.\nChanging the data or assumptions can result in different forecasts and probabilities.\n\n\nExample 1.6 What is your subjective probability that Professor Ross (the author) has a TikTok account? Consider the following two bets, and suppose you must choose only one.\n\nYou win $100 if Professor Ross has a TikTok account, and you win nothing otherwise.\nA box contains 40 green and 60 gold marbles that are otherwise identical. The marbles are thoroughly mixed and one marble is selected at random. You win $100 if the selected marble is green, and you win nothing otherwise.\n\n\nWhich of the above bets would you prefer? Or are you completely indifferent? What does this say about your subjective probability that Professor Ross has a Tik Tok account?\nIf you preferred bet B to bet A, consider bet C which has a similar setup to B but now there are 20 green and 80 gold marbles. Do you prefer bet A or bet C? What does this say about your subjective probability that Professor Ross has a Tik Tok account?\nIf you preferred bet A to bet B, consider bet D which has a similar setup to B but now there are 60 green and 40 gold marbles. Do you prefer bet A or bet D? What does this say about your subjective probability that Professor Ross has a Tik Tok account?\nContinue to consider different numbers of green and gold marbles. Can you zero in on your subjective probability?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.7 As of Jun 13, FanGraphs listed the following probabilities for who will win the 2025 MLB World Series.\n\n\n\n\nTeam\nProbability\n\n\n\n\nDodgers\n21%\n\n\nYankees\n17%\n\n\nTigers\n10%\n\n\nMets\n10%\n\n\nPhillies\n7%\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\nAccording to FanGraphs (as of Jun 13):\n\nAre the above percentages relative frequencies or subjective probabilities? Why?\n\n\nWhat must be the probability that a team other than the above five teams wins the championship? That is, what value goes in the “Other” row in the table?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dodgers are how many times more likely than the Phillies to win?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat must be the probability that the Dodgers do not win the championship? How many times more likely are the Dodgers to not win than to win (this ratio is the “odds against” the Dodgers winning).\n\n\n\n\n\nHow could you construct a circular spinner (like from a kids game) to simulate the World Series champion according to these probabilities? According to this model, what would you expect the results of 10000 repetitions of a simulation of the champion to look like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.8 Suppose your subjective probabilities for the 2025 World Series champion satisfy the following conditions.\n\nThe Brewers and Yankees are equally likely to win\nThe Phillies are 1.5 times more likely than the Yankees to win\nThe Dodgers are 2 times more likely than the Phillies to win\nThe winner is as likely to be among these four teams — Brewers, Yankees, Phillies, Dodgers — as not.\n\nConstruct a table of your subjective probabilities like the one in Example 1.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous examples illustrate two interpretations of probability: long run relative frequencies and subjective probabilities.\nWe will use these interpretations interchangeably.\nWith subjective probabilities it is often helpful to consider what might happen in a simulation.\nIt is also useful to consider long run relative frequencies in terms of relative degrees of likelihood.\nFortunately, the mathematics of probability work the same way regardless of the interpretation.\nA probability takes a value in the sliding scale from 0 to 1 (or 0 to 100%).\nDon’t just focus on computation; always remember to properly interpret probabilities.\n\n\nExample 1.9 Consider a Cal Poly student who frequently has blurry, bloodshot eyes, generally exhibits slow reaction time, always seems to have the munchies, and disappears at 4:20 each day. Which of the following, A or B, has a higher probability? Assume the two probabilities are not equal.\n\nA: The student has a GPA above 3.0.\nB: The student has a GPA above 3.0 and smokes marijuana regularly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning! Your psychological judgment of probabilities is often inconsistent with the mathematical logic of probabilities.\n\n\nExample 1.10 Ron and Leslie agree to the following bet. They’ll ask Professor Ross if he has a TikTok account. If he does, Leslie will pay Ron $200; if not, Ron will pay Leslie $100. (Neither has any direct information about whether or not Professor Ross has a TikTok account.)\n\nGiven this setup, which of the following is being judged as more likely: that Professor Ross has a TikTok account, or that he does not? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are this bet’s “odds”?\n\n\n\n\n\nRon and Leslie agree that this is a fair bet, and neither would accept worse odds. What is their subjective probability that Professor Ross has a TikTok account?\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose they were to hypothetically repeat this bet many times, say 3000 times. Given the probability from the previous part, how many times would you expect Leslie to win? To lose? What would you expect Leslie’s net dollar winnings to be? In what sense is this bet “fair”? (Remember: Leslie’s winnings are Ron’s losses and vice versa.)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe odds of an event is a ratio involving the probability that the event occurs and the probability that the event does not occur.\nOdds can be expressed as either “in favor” of or “against” the event occurring, depending on the order of the ratio.",

Be careful to clearly identify what information is reflected in probabilities\nWhen interpreting probabilities, consider the conditions under which the probabilities were computed, in the proper direction\n\n\nExample 3.2 In each of the following parts, which of the two probabilities, a or b, is larger, or are they equal? You should answer conceptually without attempting any calculations.

(FYI: especially when the jackpot is large, there are hundreds of millions of tickets sold.)          \n\n\n\nWhen interpreting probabilities, be careful not to confuse “the particular” with “the general”.\n\n“The particular:” A very specific event, surprising or not, often has low probability.\n“The general:” While a very specific event often has low probability, if there are many like events their combined probability can be high.\n\nEven if an event has extremely small probability, given enough repetitions of the random phenomenon, the probability that the event occurs on at least one of the repetitions is often high.\nIn general, even though the probability that something very specific happens to you today is often extremely small, the probability that something similar happens to someone some time is often quite high.\nWhen assessing a numerical probability, always ask “probability of what”? Does the probability represent “the particular” or “the general”? Is it the probability that the event happens in a single occurrence of the random phenomenon, or the probability that the event happens at least once in many occurrences?\nAlso distinguish between assumption and observation. For example, if you assume that a coin is fair and the flips are independent, then all possible H/T sequences are equally likely. However, if you observe the coin landing on heads on 20 flips in a row, then that might cast doubt on your assumption that the coin is fair.\n\n\nExample 3.3 Within both the colleges of Agriculture and Architecture at Cal Poly, about 49% of admitted students are female, about 84% of admitted students went to high school in CA, and the median GPA of admitted students is about 4.1.\nAn orientation group of 100 newly admitted Cal Poly students includes 75 students in Agriculture and 25 students in Architecture. A student is randomly selected from this group. The selected student is Maddie, who is female, went to high school in CA, and had a high school GPA of 4.1.\n\n\nIf you are trying to decide which college Maddie is in, is the information that she is female, went to high school in CA, and had a high school GPA of 4.1 helpful? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\nDonny Don’t says, “The information about Maddie applies equally well to Agriculture or Architecture and doesn’t help us decide which college she’s in, so it’s just 50/50. Given the information about Maddie, the conditional probability that she is in Agriculture is 0.5.” Do you agree? If not, what is the conditional probability that Maddie is in the college of Agriculture given the information about her? Hint: what was the last sentence before this example!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.4 Shuffle a standard deck of 52 playing cards (13 face values in each of 4 suits) and deal two cards without replacement.\n\n\nWhat is the probability that the first card dealt is a heart?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that the second card dealt is a heart?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that the second card dealt is a heart if the first card dealt is a heart?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that the second card dealt is a heart if the first card dealt is not a heart?\n\n\n\n\n\nRevisit part 2. What is the probability that the second card dealt is a heart? Create a two-way table to answer this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful to distinguish between conditional and unconditional probabilities.\nA conditional probability reflects additional information about the outcome of the random phenomenon.\nIn the absence of such information, we must continue to account for all the possibilities.\nWhen computing probabilities, be sure to only reflect information that is known. Especially when considering a phenomenon that happens in stages, don’t assume that when considering what happens second that you know what happened first.\n\n\nExample 3.5 Within both the colleges of Agriculture and Architecture at Cal Poly, about 49% of admitted students are female, about 84% of admitted students went to high school in CA, and the median GPA of admitted students is about 4.1.\nAn orientation group of 100 newly admitted Cal Poly students includes 75 students in Agriculture and 25 students in Architecture.

If not, what is the conditional probability that Maddie is in the college of Agriculture given the information about her?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.6 This is a very simplified example illustrating the basic idea of how insurance works. Every year an insurance company sells many thousands of car insurance policies to drivers within a particular risk class. Each policyholder pays a “premium” of $1000 at the start of the year, and the insurance company agrees to pay for the cost of all damages that occur during the year. Suppose that each policy incurs damage of either $0, $5000, $20000, or $50000 with the following probabilities.\n\n\n\nAmount of damage ($)\nProfit ($)\nProbability\n\n\n\n\n0\n1000\n0.910\n\n\n5000\n-4000\n0.070\n\n\n20000\n-19000\n0.019\n\n\n50000\n-49000\n0.001\n\n\n\nThe insurance company’s profit on a policy at the end of the year is the difference between the premium of $1000 and any damage paid out. For example, a policy that incurs no damage results in a profit of $1000; a policy that incurs $5000 in damage results in a profit of -$4000 (that is, a loss of $4000) for the insurance company.\n\n\nInterpret the probabilities 0.91, 0.07, 0.019, and 0.001 as long run relative frequencies in this context.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute the probability that a policy results in a positive profit for the insurance company.\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine 100,000 hypothetical policies. How many of these policies would you expect to result in a profit of $1000? -$4000? -$19000? -$49000?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you expect the total profit for these 100,000 policies to be?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you expect the average profit per policy for these 100,000 policies to be?\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute the probability that a policy has a profit equal to the value from part 5.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute the probability that a policy has a profit greater than the value from part 5.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the value from part 5 the most likely value of profit for a single policy?\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the value from part 5 the profit you would expect for a single policy?\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain in what sense the value from part 5 is “expected”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe long run average value of a random quantity is called its “expected value”.\nBe careful: the term “expected value” is somewhat of a misnomer.\nThe expected value is not necessarily the value we expect on a single repetition of the random phenomenon, nor the most likely value (or even a possible value).\nRather, the expected is the value we expect to see on average in the long run over many repetitions.\nA probability can be interpreted as a long run relative frequency; an expected value can be interpreted as a long run average value.\n\n\nExample 3.7 Continuing Example 3.6. We considered what we would expect for 100000 hypothetical policies, but what about an unspecified large number of policies?\n\n\nImagine that we have recorded the profit for each of a large number of policies (not necessarily 100000). Explain in words the process by which you would compute the average profit per policy. (In other, more general, words: how do you compute an average of a list of numbers?)\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that the profit of any policy is either 1000, -4000, -19000, or -49000, how could we simplify the calculation of the sum in the previous part? Write a general expression for the average profit per policy in this scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think the expression in the previous part converges to in the long run?\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain how the value in the previous part is a “probability-weighted average value”.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute the expected value of damage (not profit) as a probability-weighted average value.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpret the value from the previous part as a long run average value in this context.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is the expected value of profit related to the expected value of damage? Does this make sense? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn expected value can be computed as a “probability-weighted average value”\nBut this is just a more compact way of computing an average in the usual way: add up all the values and divide by the number of values.",
