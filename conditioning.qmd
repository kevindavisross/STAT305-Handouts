# Conditioning




-   Conditioning concerns how probabilities of events or distributions of random variables are influenced by information about the occurrence of events or the values of  random variables.
-   A probability is a measure of the likelihood or degree of uncertainty of an event.
A *conditional probability* revises this measure to reflect any "new" information about the outcome of the underlying random phenomenon.

The probability that a randomly selected American adult believes in human-driven climate change[^climate-change] is 0.54.

The probability[^party-affiliation] that a randomly selected American adult is a Democrat is 0.28.

1.  Donny Don't says that the probability that a randomly selected American adult both (1) is a Democrat, *and* (2) believes in human-driven climate change is equal to $0.28\times 0.54$. 
Do you agree?
\
\
\
\
\
1.  Suppose that the probability that a randomly selected American adult both is a Democrat and believes in human-driven climate change is 0.19. 
Construct an appropriate two-way table of probabilities.
\
\
\
\
\
1.  Compute the probability that a randomly selected American adult *who is a Democrat* believes in human-driven climate change.

1.  How can the probability in the two previous parts be written in terms of the probabilities provided (0.54, 0.28, 0.19)?

-   The **conditional probability of event $A$ given event $B$**, denoted $\text{P}(A|B)$, is defined as (provided $\text{P}(B)>0$)
$$
\text{P}(A|B) = \frac{\text{P}(A\cap B)}{\text{P}(B)}
$$
-   The conditional probability $\text{P}(A|B)$ represents how the likelihood or degree of uncertainty of event $A$ should be updated to reflect information that event $B$ has occurred.
-   In general, knowing whether or not event $B$ occurs influences the probability of event $A$.
That is,
$$
\text{In general, } \text{P}(A|B) \neq \text{P}(A)
$$
-   Be careful: order is essential in conditioning. 
That is,
$$
\text{In general, } \text{P}(A|B) \neq \text{P}(B|A)
$$
-   Within the context of two events, we have joint, conditional, and marginal probabilities.
    -   Joint: unconditional probability involving both events, $\text{P}(A \cap B)$.
    -   Conditional: conditional probability of one event given the other, $\text{P}(A | B)$, $\text{P}(B | A)$.
    -   Marginal: unconditional probability of a single event $\text{P}(A)$, $\text{P}(B)$.
-   The relationship $\text{P}(A|B) = \text{P}(A\cap B)/\text{P}(B)$ can  be stated generically as
$$
\text{conditional} = \frac{\text{joint}}{\text{marginal}}
$$
-   In many problems conditional probabilities are provided or can be determined directly.

Suppose that

-   67% of Democrats believe in human-driven climate 
-   46% of Independents believe in human-driven climate 
-   34% of Republicans believe in human-driven climate 

Also suppose that

-   28% of American adults are Democrats
-   42% of American adults are Independents
-   30% of American adults are Republicans

1.  Define the event $A$ to represent "believes in human-driven climate change" and $D, I, R$ to correspond to affiliation in each of the parties. 
If the probability measure $\text{P}$ corresponds to selecting an American adult uniformly at random, write all the percentages above as probabilities using proper notation.  
\
\
\
\
\
1.  Construct an appropriate two-way table of probabilities.
\
\
\
\
\
1.  Now suppose that the randomly selected American believes in human-driven climate change. 
How does this information change the probability that the selected American belongs to each political party? 
Answer by computing appropriate probabilities (and using proper notation).
\
\
\
\
\
1.  How many times more likely is it for an American *adult* to believe in human-driven climate change and be Independent than to:
    a.  believe in human-driven climate change and be Democrat 
    \
    \
    \
    \
    \
    a.  believe in human-driven climate change and be Republican
    \

    \
1.  How many times more likely is it for an American adult *who believes in human-driven climate change* to be Independent than to be:
    a.  Democrat

    \
    \
    a.  Republican

-   The process of conditioning can be thought of as **"slicing and renormalizing".**
    -   Extract the "slice" corresponding to the event being conditioned on (and discard the rest). 
    For example, a slice might correspond to a particular row or column of a two-way table.  
    -   "Renormalize" the values in the slice so that corresponding probabilities add up to 1.
-   Slicing determines the *shape*; renormalizing determines the *scale*.
-   Slicing determines relative probabilities; renormalizing just makes sure they add up to 1.

Roll a fair four-sided die twice.
Let $X$ be the sum of the two dice, and let $Y$ be the larger of the two rolls (or the common value if both rolls are the same).
The table below represents the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$.
